One approach to solve or mitigate the issue is to use a more straightforward approach, avoiding the combination of `calc()` with percentages and `min-content`.  For example, instead of using `calc(50% - 10px)` and `min-width: min-content`, consider the following alternatives:

**1. Using `min-width` with a fixed value:**
If a minimum width is required, specify a fixed pixel value.  This offers better predictability.  For example:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  min-width: 200px;
}
```

**2.  Using `width` with a minimum value:**
Set a `width` with a minimum value using CSS's `min()` function:

```css
div {
  width: min(calc(50% - 10px), 100%); /* 100% ensures that it doesn't exceed the parent's width */
}
```

**3. Adjusting the Layout:**
Re-evaluate the layout strategy. It might be more efficient to achieve the desired layout using flexible box (Flexbox) or Grid, offering more robust control over sizing and alignment.

The best solution depends on the overall design and requirements. These examples provide alternative methods to achieve consistent sizing and avoid unexpected behaviors.  Choose the approach that best suits your specific situation.
